This view used to bring
a smile to my face
Lately, it's done nothing
but remind me of the way
The way that you used to
give me butterflies
Took me twenty-one days to
walk our former paradise
Paradise
Step by step, brick by brick
I'm reclaiming what's mine
This city is way too small
to give away to just one guy
Street by street,
breath by breath
from the Back Bay to the sky
I'm taking back my city,
I'm taking back my life
The café where you asked me
for my name
The bookstore we spent
five hours, hiding from the rain
It's like a game of Monopoly
except I steal back
all my property
And leave you on the ground
And I know that I'll see you
one day on the street
with a girl on your arm
But I won't let that
keep me from this town
From this town
From this town
Step by step, brick by brick
I'm reclaiming what's mine
This city is way too small
to give away to just one guy
Street by street,
breath by breath
from the Back Bay to the sky
I'm taking back my city,
I'm taking back my life
I'm taking back my city
