[00:02.27] This view used to bring
[00:07.23] A smile to my face
[00:13.46] Lately it's done nothing but
[00:18.76] Remind me of the way
[00:28.76] 
[00:24.71] The way that you used to
[00:30.09] Give me butterflies
[00:35.83] Took me 21 days to
[00:39.72] Walk our former paradise
[00:47.67] Paradise, bu-bu-bu-day duh
[01:00.67] 
[00:58.52] Step by step, brick by brick
[01:03.83] I'm reclaiming what's mine
[01:10.04] This city is way too small
[01:13.74] To give away to just one guy
[01:27.74] 
[01:22.09] Street by street, breath by breath
[01:27.19] From the Back Bay to the sky
[01:33.49] I'm taking back my city
[01:39.26] I'm taking back my life
[01:50.76] 
[01:47.86] The café
[01:52.33] Where you asked me for my name
[01:58.14] The bookstore we spent
[02:00.74] Five hours hiding from the rain
[02:16.24] 
[02:08.82] It's like a game of Monopoly
[02:11.47] Except I steal back all my property
[02:14.69] And leave you on the ground
[02:20.10] And I know that I'll see you one day on the street
[02:23.34] With a girl on your arm but I won't let that keep me from this town
[02:56.84] 
[02:32.80] From this town
[02:38.57] From this town, oh
[02:47.57] 
[02:44.16] Step by step, brick by brick
[02:49.07] I'm reclaiming what's mine
[02:54.97] This city is way too small
[02:59.03] To give away to just one guy
[03:13.03] 
[03:07.30] Street by street, breath by breath
[03:12.53] From the Back Bay to the sky
[03:18.60] I'm taking back my city
[03:24.42] I'm taking back my life
[03:30.03] I'm taking back my city
